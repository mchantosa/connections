      h2 Our mission
      p To help you stay connected to those you truly care about. This is designed to be a medium agnostic, non-calendered, warm and user friendly, communication asset, intended to support a small to medium set of contacts.

      h2 Why use this manager?
      h3 Medium Agnostic
      p When my husband left Facebook, he stopped talking to all contacts through messenger. Much of how we communicate now is determined by the communication mediums we share. If we frequent one less, you lose your connectiveness with those with whom you shared that medium.  
      h3 Non-calendered
      p Suppose you care about someone enough that you don't want to forget their birthday. You probably add them to your calender. Now they are integrated into your daily meetings, dental appointments, and parent teacher conferences- the calendar of work-life balance. In my case, I look out a month ahead, apply the right filters and color coding to call them out, and make sure I coordinate a gift two weeks out for a shipping buffer. This is manageable for me; no more than this however. Everyone struggles with the calendar of work-life balance; it is stressful. Adding this type of periodic communication fidelity to your work-life balance calendar risks making connecting with your nearest and dearest a stressful task to be checked off rather than something to look forward to.
      h3 Warm and user friendly
      p How do you choose to spend your time? Yoga? Exercise (Monday and Wednesday after work)? Meditation? Reading (break between tasks and last act before bed)? Wordle (morning toilet challenge)? Chatting with an old friend? 
      br
      p If you have time for any of these, you have likely prioritized them and/or carved out a period of time to devote to them. My husband and I have commuted from DC suburbs to DC and Seattle suburbs to Seattle. The time I spent trying to repurpose my commute (1.5-2 hours each way) got me all the way through Game of Thrones. Carve out some time in your day, 15 min before bed, a cup of coffee in the morning, a lovely ferry ride... Use this time to tender your list, and enjoy it. This is the pattern of behavior this application is intended to support. 
      h3 Small-medium set of contacts
      p It is possible to have thousands of "friends" across a half-dozen applications and still be completely alone. Communication is not manifested through connectivity, it is manifested through a pattern of behavior. This application is intended to support that pattern of behavior. 
      h2 On a personal note
      p Some time ago I came across someone I didn't know referring to an old Army buddy of mine in past tense. I was initially surprised to see that... and then not surprised. I reached out to our shared peers on Facebook to confirm that he had died. No one knew, no one had spoken to him in years. I brought up his page to see if there had been any posts, no recent activity. I eventually found his obituary. This triggered the obligatory RIP post among our peer group. I did a face to face presentation to observe conversations we had shared in the past. It had been years of autogenerated birthday messages- Happy Birthday from me to you, Happy birthday from you to me. Then I saw a thread where he and our other buddy were praising my family and telling me how beautiful my kids are and how happy they were for me. That other buddy had committed suicide a couple of years before. There is something surreal about reflecting over an old thread with your morning americano and realizing you are the only one in this thread that hasn't committed suicide. I wish that my last conversations with these guys had been more meaningful than years of autogenerated Happy Birthdays.
